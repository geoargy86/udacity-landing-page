## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of
the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS
files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
